matrixdump is just a little PoC (and PoS) program i wrote in an evening
to toy with ncurses and demo how you can drive a "matrix" like view using
network data. i'm surprised no one's done this before, but it's been on my
mind since the original movie came out. 

matrixdump isn't as feature rich as tcpdump or tethereal, and the decodes
are minimal. just the protocol, IPs, ports ... nothing else. the decodes
could definitely be more interesting if you wanted to make them more
usable.

amusingly, i'm not a huge fan of the movies, they were ok but the sequels
don't get me as turned on as the original. 

anyhow, why not drive some fun with a tool like this? part of this is
me thinking about how to visualize CTF competitions, and part of it was
me delving into the world of ncurses.

what's very funny is that this shows how lousy this interface is for actually
looking at data. then again, you can say things like "porn, porn, SYN flood,
porn ..."

matrixdump contains code from dugsong's dsniff (the pcaputil routines).

BUGS

matrixdump is just a toy, and isn't very feature filled or stable.
- the scrolling is a bit wonky at times, but generall works.
- the color stuff is a bit wonky, set your term to "ansi" on some systems
  to get it to respect "-c".

INSTALLATION

i built and tested on openbsd 3.4-3.5. it uses pcap, libdnet, and ncurses.
you'll have to tweak a few things for other platforms probably. 

USE

i freely give this to the world, please keep my name on it as the license
stipulates. other than that, make it work better, have some fun, and see
if you can't visualize networks in new and interesting ways. that's why
i am giving this out now.
